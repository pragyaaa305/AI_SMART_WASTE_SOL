🗑️ AI Smart Waste Segregation Dustbin
📌 Project Description

The AI Smart Waste Segregation Dustbin is an intelligent waste-management system that uses Artificial Intelligence, image recognition, and smart sensors to automatically detect, classify, and segregate waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable sections.

The dustbin scans the waste using an AI camera, identifies the waste type, and activates a motorized flap mechanism that sends the item into the correct compartment. With touchless operation, bin-full alerts, and clean automatic sorting, this system makes waste disposal faster, hygienic, and eco-friendly.

⭐ Key Features

🔍 AI Image Detection – Identifies waste items in real time

🔄 Automatic Sorting – Motorized flaps separate waste correctly

🚫🖐️ Touchless Lid – Opens automatically using a motion sensor

📊 Smart Alerts – Notifies when the bin is full

🌱 Eco-Friendly Design – Improves recycling & reduces contamination

🏫 Ideal For – Homes, schools, offices, smart cities, hackathons

⚙️ How It Works

User approaches → sensor opens lid

Waste is placed inside → AI scans item

AI classifies waste → biodegradable / non-biodegradable

Motor rotates flap → directs waste to the right section

Sensors monitor fill level → alerts when full

🎯 Purpose

To create a smart, hygienic, and sustainable waste-management solution that reduces human effort, improves recycling accuracy, and supports clean environments.
